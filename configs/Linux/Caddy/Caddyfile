# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.

# The configuration below serves a welcome page over HTTP on port 80.  To use
# your own domain name with automatic HTTPS, ensure your A/AAAA DNS record is
# pointing to this machine's public IP, then replace `http://` with your domain
# name.  Refer to the documentation for full instructions on the address
# specification.

http:// {

    # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * /var/www/SAE203

    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:2024

    # Refer to the directive documentation for more options.

# As an alternative to editing the above site block, you can add your own site
# block files in the Caddyfile.d directory, and they will be included as long
# as they use the .caddyfile extension.
# import Caddyfile.d/*.caddyfile
